# **`Software Architecture Notes`**

## **What is a Software Architect**

### Diferences between Developer and Architect:
* Developer knows what CAN be done.
* Architect knows what SHOULD be done.

There are several architect roles in the technology industry, some examples
are:
- Infrastructure architect
  Designs infrastructure like:
  VMs, Servers, Networks, etc. She/he is the infrastructure expert.
- Software architect
- Enterprise Architect
  Works with top level management like CEO, CIO, etc. Streamlines the IT to
  support the business. No development-oriented work. Career normally paths
  are Senior Software Architect/ Experienced Project Manager.
  
### Responsibilities of the architect

>"A good architect knows that technology patterns and all the other buzzword are
>just means to the end result.

>The technology should serve the requirements and not the other way around." 
> -- <cite>Memi Lavi, Senior Software Architect & Consultant</cite>

So to summarize a software architect is someone who designs the system to 
be first secure reliable and easy to maintain and select the optimal 
technology platforms and patterns to achieve these goals.

### The architect in the organization

Architect **is not and should not be** in managerial position.

She/he does not manage vacation requests and definitely not conducting performance 
reviews or compensation negotiations.

When the architects are in a junior position normally it's contribution it's quite 
limited to the organization and only focused to the project, although, he/she sees
the big picture, but only for the project.

In senior positions architects add a tremendous value to the organization and 
normally reports directly to the CIO, they will make sure the project's architects
adhere to the organizational guidance.

### Should the architects code?

A good architect MUST know how to code, and there are some reasons for that:
* Architecture Trustworthiness
  
  You have to be able to test new technologies and platforms for yourself
  and know what it's implementable and what it's unimplementable.
* Support the Developers

  The architect must be able to help developers when they get stuck well 
  while implementing the architecture, and the minds of developers work to 
  detect deviations from the intended implementation.
* Respect

  One of the key factors to succeed as an architect is to gain the respect
  of the developers.
  
### Academic degrees and Career Path

There is no dedicated degree to architecture in software, so don't really need
a specific one, however, a Computer Science degree won't hurt. Additionally
there are some courses and certifications like TOGAF but are more geared towards
Enterprise Architecture rather than Software Architecture.

Since there is no formal degree, or a course that qualifies you as an architect.
The main factor is experience preferably in the technological field.
